Chessboard:
- msg_ready_to_send (formerly send_msg) is delcared in raspberrypi.c but actually used in gantry.c. It breaks modularity.
- chessboard uses utils a bit too much me thinks
- also chessboard seems to be using 2 different methodologies (what is this presense thing?)
- the chessboard methods seem kinda random 
- Why not use enums for things (like piece types)
- chessboard_index_to_tile needs better error handling

idea: Keep the array. To access it, figure out which bit we want from the sensornetwork. Then, multiply its position (so LSB)
by the size of the array elements, then add that to the arrays pointer. Should give the correct element (as long as arrays 
have no internal padding)

Gantry:
- We should split the different commands (chess, rel_move, and comm) to have 3 different data types
- COMM_HANDLER should probably be in gantry
- Comm command could probably make use of an entry function

Sensornetwork:
- Needs to be clearer what should be in this module vs chessboard
